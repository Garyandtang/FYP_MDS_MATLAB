# Multidimensional Scaling MATLAB implement 
A MATLAB implement of Multidimensional Scaling For Matching Low-Resolution Face Images[1].  
The input features used in this implement is PCA features.  
The dataset for testing the performance is ORL face database.  
Simply run MDS_main.m and PCA_only.m to compare the result.
